    "story": "I was born on 1st August 1999 in Alexandria, Egypt. From a young age, I developed a passion for basketball, playing actively from 6 to 16 years old, which taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. In 2017, I began studying Computer Science, exploring programming and problem-solving, and graduated in 2021 with a solid foundation in technology. After graduation, I joined the Egyptian Army, serving in the Naval Security, where I gained resilience and the ability to perform under pressure. Following my service, I started my professional career at TechHive as a Full Stack Engineer, applying my skills to real-world projects and continuously growing as a developer.",

They taught me discipline, curiosity, perseverance, and problem-solving. I am committed to continuous learning, personal growth, and making a positive impact through my work and life."
